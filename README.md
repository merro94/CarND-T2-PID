## PID Controller

The P, or "proportional", component had the most directly observable effect on the car's behavior. It causes the car to steer proportional (and opposite) to the car's distance from the lane center (which is the CTE). However, it does cause the car to oscillation if it is solely considered in the steering controller.

The D, or "differential", component counteracts the P component's tendency to ring and overshoot the center line. It makes the car to drive more smoothly.

The I, or "integral", component counteracts a bias in the CTE which prevents the P-D controller from reaching the center line. This one cannot be set with a large value as it will quickly make the car circle and not drive straight down the road.

For this project I used two PID controllers. One to control the steering angle and the other the throttle.

To tune a PID I used the following steps manually:

1. Set all parameters to zero.
2. Increase the P gain until the response to a disturbance is steady oscillation.
3. Increase the D gain until the the oscillations go away (i.e. it's critically damped).
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until increasing the D gain does not stop the oscillations.
5. Set P and D to the last stable values.
6. Increase the I gain until it brings you to the setpoint with the number of oscillations desired.

The steering PID class was initialized with the following values
```
double Kp = 0.13;  // proportional coefficient
double Ki = 0.0002;  // integral coefficient
double Kd = 4;  // differential coefficient
```

I also implemented a throttle controller to maximize the car's speed around the track. Without it and when using a constant throttle value of 0.3, the car can only drive with max speed of ~35. The throttle PID is also fed with CTE. The intuition is that when CTE is small, the total error is small and the car can run faster, and when CTE is larger and the total error is larger and the car should reduce speed and adjust to make it back to the track. So the I component is set to zero as it will grow indefinitely.

The throttle PID class was initialized with the following values

```
double Kp = 0.3;  // proportional coefficient
double Ki = 0.0;  // integral coefficient
double Kd = 0.02;  // differential coefficient
```
The throttle value is calculated with the following formula, with the target throttle is 0.6

```
throttle_value = 0.6 - pid_t.TotalError();
```
With both controllers, the car can drive around the loops with maximum speed at ~65.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
